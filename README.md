# autocrud

Autocrud is a tool to automatize CRUD on the front end. For details about the tool, check it's readme inside `autocrud/` directory.

To use autocrud (because of chrome's same origin policy), you should access the content through a web server, like:

    sudo npm install -g http-server
    
And then:

    http-server -c-1
